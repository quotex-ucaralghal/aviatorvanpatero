## Quotex: Halal or Haram?

Quotex is an online trading platform that offers binary options, forex,
and CFDs trading. The platform is operated by Awesomo LTD, a company
registered in the Republic of the Seychelles.

According to Islamic Sharia law, gambling and usurious banking are
prohibited. Binary options trading, which involves predicting the price
movement of an asset within a specified time frame, can be considered
gambling. However, Quotex also offers other financial instruments such
as forex and CFDs, which are permissible in Islam.

The halal status of Quotex depends on the specific trading activities
engaged in. If you are trading binary options, it would be considered
haram. However, trading forex and CFDs using the Quotex platform can be
halal, provided you adhere to Islamic trading principles.
